									<h1>About us</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Hi! We are a work group coursing Cloud & Big Data on the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. We are five 
									students in Software and Videogame Development that just started diving in the ocean of possibilities that 
									is the Cloud Computing and Big Data world.<br><br>

								<h3><a>Objective and use of Big Data</a></h3>
								<p>
									Initially, we did a big brainstorming session about the theme of our final proyect, searching 
									far and wide on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> datasets that could be
									worth the exploration and research and could give a nice topic to talk about.
									<br>
									Finally, we stood upon great datasets that contained thousands of entries about videogames, 
									companies, prices and much more interesting data. Our main source of information is the dataset
									<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games">steam.csv</a>:<br><br>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/kaggleexample.png" alt="" /></a><br><br>

									We also complimented this massive collection of entries with other datasets that helped us have a 
									more insightful knowledge and let us provide an understandable research conclusion.

								<h3><a>Final thoughts about the project<br /></a></h3>
								<p>
								When we started the project, we had some difficulties due to our ignorance with the methods
								and technologies we had to use. Some of our members had problems with Linux, the Cloud instances or had never used Python.<br><br>
								
								We weren't really happy with the data we used either, because some of the applications from the data were not complete or
								had some information that gave us more problems when analyzing everything. For example, videogames 
								without playtime or genres with confusing tag/names.<br><br>
								
								Despite this, we still managed to come with a well made project and to cover all the sections we planned to
								study. We are satisfied with the results, but we would have liked to offer an easier way to access our code results through this webpage,
								although we didn't have enough web engeneering knowledge to make some of our code functionality to work on the web.
