                            <p style="text-align: center;">We started working with multiple datasets from kaggle but we finally decided
                                to work with a dataset from <a href="https://steamspy.com/">steamspy</a>, which offered us the information we wanted for our study.
                                This dataset contains information  about more than 25000 videogames and data about their sales, playtime, tags, developers... <br />
                                Using this data, we managed to compare and get information about thousands of applications in just a few seconds.

                            <p style="text-align: center;">To construct our data and analyze it we are using pyspark both in local and a hadoop cluster.
                                Through these applications, we manage to produce new organised data which is the processed using other python scripts with
                                the matplotlib library to generate diagrams to visualize the results.

                            <p style="text-align: center;">We have divided our project in two separate sections.
                                On the one hand, we have our script that get you specific information about the data, such as average prices or
                                average playtime for different aspects of the games. On the other hand, we have developed a script to recommend specific videogames
                                according to a player's preferences. Click on READ MORE to se more detailed information.

                            <p style="text-align: center;">There are two ways to run our code. That is in local mode and in cluster mode, 
                                which is possible using an AWS (Amazon Web Services) instance. In this section we explain how to use
                                both options.
                            </p>

                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

                                        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Local Mode</h3>
                                        <p>In order to run our applications in local mode using Linux Ubuntu or an 
                                            Ubuntu virtual machine in Windows, we need:

                                            <ul>
												<li>Python installed</li>
												<li>Spark installed</li>
												<li>Steam.csv downloaded (you can find it in the dataset section of this page)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            
                                            Once we have all the requirements, we can easily run the code with the following command line:

                                            <pre><code>$spark-submit file_name.py "argument"</code></pre>

                                            Where "argument" is only included for the execution of codes that need an argument, such as 
                                            GameRecommendation.py, which needs a game as an argument in order to operate correctly.

                                        </p>

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col-6 col-12-small">

                                        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cluster Mode</h3>
                                        <p>In order to run our applications in cluster mode using an AWS instance:

                                            <ul>
												<li>Python installed in our instance</li>
												<li>Spark installed in our instance</li>
												<li>Steam.csv downloaded in our instance(you can find it in the dataset section of this page)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            
                                            Once we have all the requirements, we can run the code with the following command line:

                                            <pre><code>$spark-submit --num-executors N --executor-cores M  file_name.py "argument"</code></pre>

                                            Where:
                                            <ul>
												<li>N is the number of worker nodes</li>
												<li>M is the number of cores per worker node</li>
												<li>"argument" is only included for the execution of codes that need an argument, such as 
                                                    GameRecommendation.py, which needs a game as an argument in order to operate correctly.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            

                                        </p>

                                    </div>
                                </section>
                                <!-- Performance -->
                                <section class="post">
                                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Performance</h2>
                                    <p style="text-align: center;">We tested the performance of our scripts both locally 
                                        and in an AWS cluster (m4.xlarge to be precise), trying many numer of cores. 
                                        We tested the scrip GameRecommendation.py, since we consider its the most complex one 
                                        regarding data processing out of our scripts. Howewer, to our surprise, we did not obtain 
                                        the results we expected. We barely saw any difference in any of the tests, obtaining execution 
                                        times around 14s for every execution. After thinking about it, we came to the conclusion that the execution times
                                        barely change since the size of the data we are processing is not big enough to make a noticeable 
                                        difference when processing in a cluster.
